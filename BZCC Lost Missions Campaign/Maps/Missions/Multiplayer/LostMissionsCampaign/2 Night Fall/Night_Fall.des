-=Night Fall=-

Play a "lost" mission after "Transport"

You are Mjr. Collins and you were suppose
to meet with Red Squad. You go back on that planet to rescue what is left of Red Squad.

As you meet Green Squad, you will need their constructors for a vital defense against the Scions.

Evacuation is not immediate. A mysterious structure is blocking your signal.
