Dropship 2 reported Lt. Simms killed in action as he was leaving the planets surface. Morale in carrier orbit is at an all time low since Commander Shabayev is reported "missing in action". 

Analysis of the transport showcase that the readings of this technology point towards Siwa's moon (Hecate). At zero eight hundred hours (seven hours from now), the second fleet will embark on Hecate. 

You (Major Collins) are going back to Siwa. Dropship 2's original orders were to save the transport, Lt. Simms, Commander Covell, and Captain Higgs.
