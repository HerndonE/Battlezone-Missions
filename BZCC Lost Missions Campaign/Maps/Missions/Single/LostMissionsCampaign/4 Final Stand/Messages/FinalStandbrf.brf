This will be the biggest ISDF invasion known to mankind. There has never been an operation that had all squad colors in concert together fighting the enemy. Sgt. Mates has delivered the engineering constructors and will showcase their talents. Commander Covell will provide countermeasures to the northeast. Major Manson is officially "missing in action" after negotiations on Rend. Harper is assigning you (Major Collins) to Blue Squad.

Many lives and careers depend on this mission. A special headquarters will be constructed so sky-eye can see the alien structure at all times.
