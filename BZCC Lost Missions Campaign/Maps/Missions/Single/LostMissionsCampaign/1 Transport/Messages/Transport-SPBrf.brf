Welcome to Siwa! This is Mire's sister planet. The intelligence officers conclude that the Scion signatures on this planet are to low to be considered as a threat. However, the intelligence analysts have picked up a reading that can be found in Scion crafts.

Red Squad is dispatched to investigate. Sgt. Masiker (Major Mansons right hand man) will assist Red Squad. Green Squads engineering team will recon the greater area of interest. You (Lt. Simms) are ordered by Major Collins to be in concert with Blue Squads assignment.  

This mission is off the record and is a need to know basis from Braddock and his command.
