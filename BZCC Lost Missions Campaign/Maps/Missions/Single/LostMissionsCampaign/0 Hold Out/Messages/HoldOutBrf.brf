ISDF command is setting sights on a new base and will be naming it Charon. This base is to create a stronghold against the Scion threat.

There has been one landing party that has attempted to claim that sector and failed. Major Collins and Commander Shabayev will be assign to you (Lt. Simms) along with the second wave. Expectations are high.

Major Manson will assist you until he fixes the fiasco in the field with Lt. Cooke.
